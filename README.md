# IMC Calculator App  

The **IMC Calculator App** is a Flutter-based application designed to calculate the Body Mass Index (BMI) and provide a diagnosis based on the result.  
The primary goal of this project is to study and demonstrate Flutter's adaptability and responsiveness across various devices and screen sizes, while maintaining a consistent and appealing design.

## Features  
- **BMI Calculation**: Users can input their weight (in kilograms) and height (in meters) to calculate their BMI.  
- **Diagnosis**: The app provides a classification of the BMI, such as "Underweight," "Normal," "Overweight," or "Obesity."  
- **Responsiveness**: The app is built to showcase responsiveness, ensuring a seamless user experience across different devices, including smartphones, tablets, and desktops.  
- **Custom Widgets**: Includes reusable and customizable widgets for better modularity and maintainability.  

## Testing  
The app includes a variety of tests to ensure its reliability and correctness:  
- **Unit Tests**: To validate the core logic, such as BMI calculations and diagnosis.  
- **Widget Tests**: To verify the correct rendering and behavior of individual widgets.  
- **Integration Tests**: To simulate user interactions and ensure the app works as expected end-to-end.  


This project serves as an example of a well-structured Flutter application with a focus on adaptability, responsiveness, and comprehensive testing.
